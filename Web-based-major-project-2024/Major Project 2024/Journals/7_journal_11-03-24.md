Action 1: I have sorted the layout of the selected recipes page and researched into how  data can be passed from one page to another to display the correct recipe. This could be done using cookies or saving data to the users device and then getting it later once on the new page.

Hours: 2

Action 2: I have managed to display the test data on a selected recipe to see how a complete recipe would look on the final product. I have also added a way to see all the ingredients for all the test recipes on the shopping list page.

Hours: 3

Action 3: I have added an explanation of what each page does in the component structure section and added the queries to create the tables in the database. I have also added screenshots of the local JSON data I created to test if some of the data will display correctly on the front end.

Hours: 3

Action 4: Completed the Technical design document. I added the SQL queries to create the tables as well as some sample data to show how the data would look in the tables. I made improvements to my prototype based on feedback to make sure they work better with the use cases outlined in the business analysis document.

Hours: 6
