Action 1: I have added the tasks that I completed last week to the previous journal based on feedback.

Hours: 1

Action 2: I have added an introduction to my UI design and evaluation document as well as finishing the detailed design that has views of the wide screen version as well as the mobile version.

Hours: 5

Action 3: I have added an explanation for my design choices for each of the pages as well as the features that may appear on the pages. I have created a set of questions for some test users to answer to evaluate my design. These questions are a mix of quantitative and quality answers. The aim is to have at least 5 people evaluate the design. I also made a Google form to get answers from users with a varying range of computer and web knowledge.

Hours: 6

Action 4: I have linked my design back to my use cases and evaluated some questions from my questionnaire to see if they meet the requirements in the use cases.

Hours: 1

TOTAL HOURS: 13
