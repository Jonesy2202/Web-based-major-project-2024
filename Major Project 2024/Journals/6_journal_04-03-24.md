Action 1: I have connected my intellij to PostgreSQL and created 4 tables for the passwords, users, planners and recipes. I have also added a GetDBConntection file to connect to the database but have had issues with Undefined constants for the information stored in a secret file containing the data to connect to the database.

Hours: 3

Action 2: I have added the necessary forms for the page to add recipes with no functionality. This page will be almost the same as the edit page, the only difference being that the edit page will have the fields already filled in for users to edit. I still need to do some research into how the images that are uploaded from users are stored, so they can be displayed in the recipes.

Hours: 4

Action 3: I have looked into some of the Google Material icons and added them to some of the buttons and pages as a response to feedback from the questionnaire. I have also looked into using svgrepo but ended up using the ones made by Google and added a link to their style sheet to have access to all of their icons.

Hours: 2
