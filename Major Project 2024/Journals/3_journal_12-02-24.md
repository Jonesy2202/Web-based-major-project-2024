Action 1: Added bug tracker table to track bugs.

Hours: 1

Action 2: I Have completed the Business analysis document and added all necessary parts including the introduction, rich picture diagram, use case diagram, users and related sites. The rich picture outlines how the site can be used in a real environment and how it will fit in. The use case diagram gives an outline of all the tasks that can be carried out on the website. The example users will all be able to use the system in the same way to suit their needs. There is a need for an admin user to be able to change passwords if needed and possibly delete users if necessary.

Hours: 7

Action 3: I have made further progress on the navigation bar and have settled on a uniform look and colour scheme that could work for the final design. I have also added some forms that have no functionality on the login page.

Hours: 2

Action 4: I have added a form with some css to position forms correctly to get a better idea of what the final design could look like.

Hours: 2

TOTAL HOURS: 12
